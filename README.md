# ionicApp
An Ionic framework Demo App

## ultimate goal

My ultimate goal is to build an App using AngularJs, Ionic framework, cordova etc., which App must be MVC type coded, and must 
use cordova to test a few cell phone hardware function (camera at least).

Data service supported by springMVC based server.

Combining both front App and data server , I intend to build an picture share platform.
